Hotel booking analysis using Microsoft Power BI


The hotel industry is one of the most important components of the wider service industry, catering for customers who require overnight accommodation. The tourism and travel industries like hospitality, cruising, theme parks, etc., have different requirements and particularities that cannot be fully explored without industryâ€™s specific data. 
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, number of cancellations, length of stay, the number of adults, children, type of customers, among other things.

Here we attempt to find insights from the given data set using Microsoft Power BI to understand booking patterns, cancellations and thereby maximize profit.
